login-page
==========

Description
-----------

This is is a sign-in and sign-up form that changes background as you refresh.
Instead of having a really lame page, why not make it a little different each time?

It was inspired by [Tumblr's login page](http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard)

None of the back-end stuff is done, obviously. This is just the front-end made to look pretty.
Light backgrounds have dark text, and vice-versa.
